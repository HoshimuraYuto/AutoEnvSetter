AutoEnvSetter is a tool that allows you to easily build a Javascript/Typescript (+react, etc.) development environment.

## Usage

To use AutoEnvSetter, you can run the script locally by following these steps:

1. Create your own project directory and move to the project directory.

```sh
mkdir your/project/directory && cd your/project/directory
```

2. Download the ZIP file from [here](https://github.com/HoshimuraYuto/AutoEnvSetter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to the root of your project directory.

3. Unzip the file. Make sure the AutoEnvSetter folder is set up as follows

```
ðŸ—‚ (Project directory)
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ—‚ AutoEnvSetter
    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ—‚ bin
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ install.sh
    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

4. Run `sh AutoEnvSetter/bin/install.sh`.

```sh
sh AutoEnvSetter/bin/install.sh
```

5. If you choose playwright for your test, you will see `TODO: Please edit webServer in the playwright.config.ts file as follows.` Please follow the instructions. Please follow the instructions.
